Holy crap - I don't want to speak too soon (what I usually do when I get excited about something), but I started rubbing extra strength [Voltaren](https://www.voltaren.ca/) (diclofenac) on my shoulder last night, and maybe it took a while to work (it said it could take up to a week, like the cortisone injection), but right at this second, my shoulder pain is 100% gone! My goodness, it's about time!!! 

I've been suffering from [bursitis](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/bursitis) in one of my shoulders ever since I got COVID (Omicron variant) about a month ago. Yes, apparently COVID (and other viruses) can trigger bursitis, which is inflammation of a bursa (a bursa is a closed, fluid-filled sac that works as a cushion and gliding surface to reduce friction between tissues of the body). Anyway, bursitis is super-painful and I've been awakening 3-4 times every night to get a new ice pack and take more acetaminophen, carbamol, and codeine.

Anyway, it's amazing that I didn't notice the pain was gone. I was just working away at my desk and all of a sudden I realized I had no pain anymore!!

I'm pretty sure it's because of the diclofenac (Voltaren) balm. I first rubbed it on last night before I went to bed, and I reapplied this morning, and again just now. 

Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) like ibuprofen and naproxen. 

If I'm correct, this is an amazing life-hack I wish I had known about years ago. Instead of swallowing an oral NSAID that affects one's whole body, and is hard on the stomach and kidneys, just rub it onto the affected joint and leave the rest of the body alone! ðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž

It says one is not supposed to use diclofenac at the same time as ibuprofen or naproxen, so that's what I've done. 

I'm super optimistic now!!! ðŸ˜ƒ

Have I just discovered the cure for bursitis??? In all my research, not once did I find a recommendation to use diclofenac for bursitis. But to me this makes so much sense! Bursitis is local inflammation, and diclofenac reduces local inflammation. Surprisingly, for me, this might even work better than the cortisone injection I got a couple weeks ago (steroid injection straight into the bursa sac in my shoulder). 

The real test will be tonight since the pain is always worst at nighttime... Wish me luck! ðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž
