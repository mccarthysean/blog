This article shows you how to install, configure, and run [Unbound](https://unbound.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/) as your local DNS cache on Ubuntu Linux, on an AWS EC2 server. This way you're not running too many DNS lookups from, say, your web app to your managed AWS RDS database, and seeing weird errors like "Temporary failure in name resolution"...

Here's a link to the [Unbound documentation](https://unbound.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/), which is really helpful.

I previously wrote an [article]({% post_url 2024-09-12-install-dnsmasq-with-systemd-resolved-on-ubuntu-linux-aws-ec2 %}) about how to install dnsmasq, working together with systemd-resolved, but Unbound is so much easier, and it *just works*.

# Run all of the following in order 
* It's pretty much a script, but best to do it one line at a time

Check whether this is to run on VPC (default) or EC2 classic and set NAMESERVER accordingly
```bash
INTERFACE=$(curl --silent http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/network/interfaces/macs/ | head -n1)
IS_IT_CLASSIC=$(curl --write-out %{http_code} --silent --output /dev/null http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/network/interfaces/macs/${INTERFACE}/vpc-id)

if [[ $IS_IT_CLASSIC == '404' ]]
then
  NAMESERVER="172.16.0.23"
else
  NAMESERVER="169.254.169.253"
fi

echo "IS_IT_CLASSIC = $IS_IT_CLASSIC (old Kapua 200 response, new reserved instance, 401)"
echo "NAMESERVER = $NAMESERVER"
```

You should see something like `NAMESERVER = 169.254.169.253` (the main AWS Route53 nameserver)

Install the Unbound package, Unbound-Anchor package for DNS security, the `dig` package, and the DHCP client.
```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install unbound unbound-anchor dnsutils isc-dhcp-client -y
```

Create a configuration file, including the Amazon DNS resolver for resolving hosts on your private VPC.
```bash
echo -e "server:\n\
    port: 53\n\
    interface: 127.0.0.1\n\
    access-control: 127.0.0.0/8 allow\n\
    do-ip4: yes\n\
    do-ip6: no\n\
    do-udp: yes\n\
    do-tcp: yes\n\
    num-threads: 2\n\
    num-queries-per-thread: 1024\n\
    hide-identity: yes\n\
    hide-version: yes\n\
    prefetch: yes\n\
    verbosity: 1\n\
    # Root hints (can be updated by unbound-anchor)\n\
    # root-hints: "/var/lib/unbound/root.hints"\n\
\n\
forward-zone:\n\
    name: \".\"\n\
    # Amazon's DNS resolver (likely 169.254.169.253)\n\
    forward-addr: $NAMESERVER\n\
\n\
# root key file, automatically updated\n\
auto-trust-anchor-file: "/var/lib/unbound/root.key"\n\
" | sudo tee /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/unbound.local.conf > /dev/null
```

Check it
```bash
cat /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/unbound.local.conf
```

Manually update the root trust anchor for DNSSEC validation
```bash
sudo unbound-anchor -a "/var/lib/unbound/root.key"
```

Check it to ensure it exists now
```bash
cat /var/lib/unbound/root.key
```

Check the Unbound configuration files for syntax errors or misconfigurations
```bash
sudo unbound-checkconf
```

Create /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/dhcp3
sudo touch /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf || true
echo -e "
#supersede domain-name "fugue.com home.vix.com";\n\
prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;\n\
request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,\n\
domain-name, domain-name-servers, host-name,\n\
netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope;" | sudo tee /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf > /dev/null
```

Check it
```bash
cat /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
```

Make the localhost 127.0.0.1 the main (local) DNS resolver, if you have systemd-resolved installed
```bash
echo "Old /etc/systemd/resolved.conf contents: " && cat /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
sudo sed -i 's/^#DNS=.*$/DNS=127.0.0.1/' /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
```

Enable DNS security (highly recommended)
```bash
sudo sed -i 's/^#DNSSEC=yes.*$/DNSSEC=yes/' /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
```

Use Unbound instead of systemd-resolved (i.e. we don't want systemd-resolved to be the DNS Stub Listener)
```bash
sudo sed -i 's/^#DNSStubListener=yes.*$/DNSStubListener=no/' /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
sudo sed -i 's/^#DNSStubListener=no.*$/DNSStubListener=no/' /etc/systemd/resolved.conf

echo "New /etc/systemd/resolved.conf contents: " && cat /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
sudo systemctl reload-or-restart systemd-resolved
```

Check if it works at this time
```bash
dig aws.amazon.com
sudo systemctl status systemd-resolved
```

For dnsmasq to work, iptables mustn't block the DHCP port
```bash
sudo ufw allow bootps
```

Stop systemd-resolved and dnsmasq first, if they're running
```bash
sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq.service
sudo systemctl disable dnsmasq.service

sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved

sudo systemctl status systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl status dnsmasq.service
```

Edit the /etc/resolv.conf file manually and ensure it contains the following line at the top:
```bash
nameserver 127.0.0.1
```

Start Unbound
```bash
sudo systemctl start unbound.service
sudo systemctl status unbound.service
```

Test the service and configure dhclient accordingly.
Set the dnsmasq DNS cache as the default DNS resolver.
Note: You must suppress the default DNS resolver that DHCP provides.
To do this, change or create the /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file.
```bash
echo "supersede domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1, ${NAMESERVER};" | sudo tee /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf > /dev/null 
```

Apply the change (orâ€¦ `sudo systemctl restart network`)
```bash
sudo dhclient
```

Test that DNS lookups work now!
```bash
dig aws.amazon.com @127.0.0.1
dig google.com @127.0.0.1 | grep -B3 Query
dig microsoft.com
```

# Optional Step

By default, systemd-resolved creates a symbolic link at /etc/resolv.conf that points to a local DNS stub (127.0.0.53). You can remove this link and replace it with a standard /etc/resolv.conf file if you like.
```bash
echo "/etc/resolv.conf contents:" && cat /etc/resolv.conf
ls -la /etc/resolv.conf
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

Make the file *not* immutable, so we can delete, move, or change it.
```bash
sudo chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf
# sudo unlink /etc/resolv.conf 
sudo mv /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.bak-Sep-11-2024
```

Create a new /etc/resolv.conf file manually, specifying a DNS server (e.g., Google's public DNS or another one you prefer):
```bash
sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver ${NAMESERVER}" > /etc/resolv.conf'
```

Prevent systemd or other services from modifying your new /etc/resolv.conf file, you can set it as immutable
```bash
sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf
```

To undo the above and make the file *mutable* again, run `sudo chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf`

Check the permissions, and whether it's a file. Previously it was a symlink.
```bash
ls -la /etc/resolv.conf
```

Verify dnsmasq works correctly
```bash
dig aws.amazon.com @127.0.0.1
```
