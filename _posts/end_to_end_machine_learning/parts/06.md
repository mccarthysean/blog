Part 6 focuses on deploying the finished machine learning web app to a production server using [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) and [Traefik](https://traefik.io/). Traefik is a modern reverse-proxy server purposefully built for microservices. It works great with Docker Swarm. Docker Swarm is an excellent solution for load-balancing and scaling a web app with multiple replicas on different nodes (servers).

**Tools and Technologies:** Docker Swarm, Traefik, Gunicorn, AWS EC2 or Digital Ocean server
