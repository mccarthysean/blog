This part focused on *productionalizing* the machine learning model from Part 3. In other words, instead of using a Jupyter Notebook, which is great for interactive Python, data science, and exploratory data analysis, we'll build the machine learning right into the web app and make it interactive for the end user.

**Tools and Technologies:** Python, Flask, Dash
