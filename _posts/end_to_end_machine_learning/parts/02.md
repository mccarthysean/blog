The second part of this course focuses on adding Dash to our Flask web app, so we can have a React-based Single-page Application (SPA) for our machine learning model. We'll configure the Dash layout using Dash HTML objects, and then dive into Dash callbacks for interactivity, such as choosing the industry and stock, and downloading fresh stock price data to our TimescaleDB database. The best thing about Dash is that it requires no JavaScript, even though it uses React JavaScript behind the scenes. When you're finished, you'll have a full-featured, interactive web app, built solely with Python!
