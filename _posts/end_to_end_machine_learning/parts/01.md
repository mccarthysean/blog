The first part of this course focuses on using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to set up the specialized [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/) database, and [PGAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) for managing it. TimescaleDB is a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) extension, so it has ALL of the regular Postgres functionality *plus* some awesome features geared toward time series data.

We'll also set up a [Python](https://www.python.org/)-based [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) web application as our base web app, in preparation for Part 2, where we'll add [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) to make it interactive and *[React](https://reactjs.org/)*ive.

**Tools and Technologies:** Python, Flask, Docker, TimescaleDB, PostgreSQL, PGAdmin, Flask-SQLAlchemy
