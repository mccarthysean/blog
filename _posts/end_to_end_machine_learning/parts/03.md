The third part of this course focuses on machine learning. We'll use an interactive Jupyter notebook to do our exploratory data analysis, visualization, feature engineering, machine learning model training, hyper-parameter tuning, and cross-validation testing. Lots of fancy words there, but that's your typical machine learning workflow. When you're finished, you'll have your own machine learning pipeline which can easily be used in other projects. Exciting stuff.

**Tools and Technologies:** Jupyter Notebooks, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib
